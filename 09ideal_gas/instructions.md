# Ideal gas law

Write a method that uses the "ideal gas law" to calculate the pressure of a gas that is contained
in a given volume (v), has a given temperature (t) and has a chemical amount of (n). You don't need
to care about the units of the values.

Look for the formula [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas_law).

Where:

- P is pressure
- n is chemical amount (no need to deal with the unit)
- R is the ideal gas constant and have a constant value of 8.314
- T is temperature
- V is volume

Your program should implement a method calculate_pressure that takes chemical ammount (n),
temperature (t), and v and returns the pressure (p)-

```ruby
def calculate_pressure(chemical_amount, temperature, volume)

end
```
